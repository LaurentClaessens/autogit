This program loops over the directory given in argument and let you know what directory need a 'git commit'.

If you are able to install/use Jgit under Ubuntu, explain me and I would be glad to remove my crappy 'Git.java' and 'CommandLine' code.

Next improvements :

* graphical interface (one window by directory needing a commit or something)
* help to update .gitignore
* help making 'git add *'
* propose a 'git diff'
* propose a 'git commit -a'
